NDVM is under pre-alpha stage, on **INITIAL** work.

Target: NDVM is proposed to work on Linux, Mac OSX, Windows and FreeBSD (maybe more later..), but for the initial support it will target only linux, for a faster development.

Pull Request are always welcome! Just make sure the code is clean and that you've tested it a bit.
